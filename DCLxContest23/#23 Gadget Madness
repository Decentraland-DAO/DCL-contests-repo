You're a mad scientist 👨‍🔬 👩‍🔬 & just cannot RESIST the urge to create something new 🧪🧪. That's when you were struck by divine inspiration :


"A gadget! I need to create gadgets! Ev.. Everyone is using them! I need to create my own GENIUS invention.. I need to have a gadgeeeeeeet with my NAME on it!!!". 

As you start throwing fourniture around the room, and assemble several mismatched pieces together with your magnet-o-XX, the room becomes a mess. Books, research sketches, etc are wildly spread around... Heck! You even destroyed the walls to extract more material to experiment with!!

But there it is, on your special Assembly Desk, the work was done. In tears, you pick up the gadget you built & decide to use it for the first time..... (silence).

Did it work? Did it fail? Is it useful? Is it useless? Who knows.. For now, the story ends here.

📢 Challenge: Recreate the scene described above & Build the wearable GADGET of the scientists dreams


🛠️ Build constraints: 🛠️ 


For this contest, we wanted to try something new and very creative:
Use the story as a base inspiration to immerse yourself in the context. Everything around it can be fully customised. You can even adapt the storyline a bit if you want, as long as it keeps & follows the main narrative.  

The end result should include some animations to represent the emotions the Scientist went through at least. At best, you would be able to recreate the entire scene - animated from start to finish!

Creativity will be rewarded! 

The representation needs to fit within a 2x2 plot sized build (maximum)
- Max. polycount: 40k
- Height limit: 46m
- File Size Limit: 24mb


🛠️ Presentation constraints: 🛠️


The presentation is very flexible, but it needs to:

1. Present the asset from all sides
2. Include a section of the presentation where you can see the asset deployed in Decentraland

Note: You can create cinematic trailers, renders, etc. in any way you want as long as you respect the 2 rules above
