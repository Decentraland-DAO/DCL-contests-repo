After running through the different lands of decentraland, you stumbled across a rare sight: A mysterious relic from an ancient civilization!! But when coming back home, nobody believed your tales! It is now your task to recreate how that relic looked like and convince them!

Are you up for the challenge? 

Challenge: The goal is for participants to create a scene picturing the moment when you, the explorer, discovered the mysterious relic in the wild lands of Decentraland. 

The representation needs to fit within a 2x2 plot sized build (maximum)
- Max. polycount: 40k
- Height limit: 46m
- File Size Limit: 60mb
- If possible, recreate the scene of discovery of the relic in your presentation
- The video presentation needs to showcase the build in Decentraland (you are still allowed to do a cinematic intro / sequence outside of DCL)
[BONUS] If you add cryptic meaning to your creation (some form of miniature easter egg hunt)
