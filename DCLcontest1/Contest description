CONTEST #1 - MIX & TWIST

The concept of Mix and twist is simple:

First, you need to create/pick 2 completely unrelated objects that would individually have no business being associated.

Your goal:
MIX & TWIST these objects into a new one that would have a concrete and real usecase in our daily lives.
The finished object can be themed and follow any colour palette you want.
