CONTEST #1 - MIX & TWIST

The concept of Mix and twist is simple:

First, you need to create/pick 2 completely unrelated objects that would individually have no business being associated.

Your goal:
MIX & TWIST these objects into a new one that would have a concrete and real usecase in our daily lives.
The finished object can be themed and follow any colour palette you want.

RULESET:

- Use BLENDER or any 3D modeling software to create the asset (no voxels)
- Build within 1 parcel maximum, e.g. a 16x16 meter space
- 20m build height
- 10k polycount limit
