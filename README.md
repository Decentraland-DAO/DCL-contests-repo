# Sandstorm DCL-contests
Repository for Decentraland X Sandstorm competition submissions

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

(1) Repository user

If you decide to use an asset that is part of this repository, make sure to ALWAYS credit the builder as well as Sandstorm for providing access to these files. One way to credit is for instance tagging both on twitter (the respective builder & @sandstormmeetup).

We made sure to include the names of the respective builders in every single asset file, make sure to look them up either on the sandstorm platform or on twitter & give them a shoutout. This will be greatly appreciated by the community & allow us to generate more incentive around publishing works within an open source repository.

(2) Who is highlighted?

Builders who voluntarily provided Sandstorm the asset files of their contest submissions are included in this repository. BUT this repository isn't limited to contest submissions, if you want to contribute even outside of the contest submissions, see below.

If you're willing to contribute within this Sandstorm open-source repository, whether it be for contest submissions or any other asset that you would be willing to open up to the entire community, feel free to fill out this form: https://forms.gle/3z72cjP5pvg4RbTa6 

If you have any questions or ideas in regards to incentives that could be built around this open-sourcing idea, feel free to reach out to oscom@sandstorm.co
