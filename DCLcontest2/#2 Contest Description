THEME: A Blip in Time

You must develop an iconic invention from any period in time (e.g. the wheel, printing press, pyramids, clock, guillotine, boat, car, lightbulb, flight, etc.)

However, pay close attention to detail for the time period you choose. You want to try to depict the item in its most originally form – if you choose a boat, you shouldn’t build a modern-day speedboat. It should be representative of the first boats ever made)

Animate the object for its intended use (4second minimum)
