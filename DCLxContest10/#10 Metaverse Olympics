Athletes from all around the world have been training years for this one opportunity – the Metaverse Olympics. These events will truly challenge the competitors and put their avatar’s skills to the test. Billions of people are expected to be viewing and hundreds of thousands are expected to attend in person (avatar).

Challenge: Develop a Stadium and an avatar animation that shows off what sporting event will take place there. (e.g. if building a soccer stadium, animate a soccer kick or goalie throw, etc..)

Build constraints:
You can use SDK for deployment but the judging will be based on your modeling and animation
