Theme: The Lost Island

After drinking from The Lost Fountain you fall to the ground and lose consciousness. When you finally come to, you look around and realize you are in a completely different place. In an attempt to figure out what happened and where you are you start exploring the island.

Challenge: Develop The Lost Island on a 2x2 Estate

Requirements:
• At least 1 item on the island must include animations

• Height limit: 46m
• File Size: 60mb

*note - respecting the art direction of the lost fountain (past contest) was not necessary
