Textures used for models:
- Color palette from Decentraland builder
- Wood for doors: https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Planks003
- Water: https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Ice003

I have edited texture color to be more suitable for my work.
Textures that are not included in links above have been created by me using Inkscape (free and open-source vector graphics editor).
